## Built-in Sequences

- Container sequences: 
  - Can hold items of different types (list, tuple, collection.deque)
  - Holdes references to the objects it contains.

- Flat sequences: 
  - Hold items of simple type (str, bytes, array.array)
  - Stores the value of its contents in its own memory space  
  - more compact, but limited toholding primitive machine values

- Mutable sequences
  - list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque

- Immutable sequences
  - typle, str, bytes


## List comprehension, generator expr

Walrus operator (:=), Remains accssible

To initialize tuples, arrays, ..., you could start from listcomp, but genexp saves memory because it yields items one by one (iterator protocol). Syntax is similar but with parentheses.


## Tuples are not just immutable lists
