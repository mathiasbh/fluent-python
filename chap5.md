# Data Class Builders

- Data class: In python it's easy to build simple class that is just a collection of fields, with little or no extra functionality
- This chapter cover three class builders you may use as shortcuts to write data classes
  - `collections.namedtuple`
  - `collectionstyping.NamedTuple`: requires type hints on fields
  - `@dataclasses.dataclass`: decorator that allows for more custom



## Overview of Data Class builders 

```
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, lat, lon):
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon
```

- Does the job of holding latitiude and longitude attributes
- `__init__` boilerplate becomes old fast 
- and it doesnt even give basic features that we expect (`==` compares object IDs, `__repr__` not helpful)
- Implementation using `namedtuple`
```
from collections import namedtuple
Coordinate = namedtuple('Coordinate', 'lat lon')

import typing 
Coordinate = typing.NamedTuple('Coordinate', [('lat', float), ('lon', float)])
```
  - now printing gives info, comparison works
- `5_coordinates.py`
  - although `NamedTuple` appears as super-class, it is not. It uses metaclass


### Main features

- Mutable instances: 
  - `namedtuples` build `tuple` subclasses and therefore immutable.
  - `dataclass` mutable, but accepts `frozen=True`
- Class statement syntax
  - `typing` and `dataclass` support regular class statement - easier to add methods and docstrings...
- Construct dict 
  - both `tuples` provide `._asdict` to construct dict. `dataclass` provides function `dataclasses.asdict`
- Get field names and default values
  - all three lets you get field names and values


## Classic named tuples

- `collections.namedtuple` is a factory that builds subclasses of `tuple` enhanced with
  - field names
  - class name
  - informative `__repr__`
- Can be used anywhere where `tuple`s are needed
- `abc = namedtuple('typename', 'field_names') -> class with name typename(fieldname1 = ..., fieldname2 = ...)`


```
Coordinate = namedtuple('Coordinate', 'lat lon reference', defaults=['WGS84'])
Coordinate(0,0) --> Coordinate(lat=0, lon=0, reference='WGS84')
Coordinate._field_defaults --> {'reference': 'WGS84'}
```


## Typed named tuples

The above can be re-written using `typing.NamedTuple`

```
class Coordinate(typing.NamedTuple):
    lat: float
    lon: float
    reference: str = 'WGS84'
```


## Type hints 101

Type hints or Type Annotations
- ways to declare expected type of function arguments, return values, variables, attributes
- They are not enforced at all by python bytecode compiler and interpreter


### No runtime effects

- Type hints can be thought as "documentation that can be verified by IDEs and type checkers"
- They have no impact on runtime in python
- use mypy

### Variable annotation syntax
Syntax

- `var_name: some_type` (`lat: float`)
- `list[int], tuple[str, float]`
- `typing,Optional` like `Optional[str]` to declare field that can be `str` or `None`
- `var_name: some_type = some_value` (`lat: float = 1.5`)


### Meaning of variable annotations

- Type hints have no effect at runtime
- When module is loaded, then python read them and build `__annotations__` that `NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` then use.
- `__annotations__` is created to record the type hints in source code

## More about `@dataclass`
- Decorator accepts several keyword arguments
  - ```
  @dataclass(*, init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False,
    unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False)
  ```
  - frozen makes isntances "immutable"
- Defaults are most useful settings in common cases
- Frozen to protect accidental changes
- order allows for sorting


### Field Options
- In `@dataclass` instantiating attribute list `some_var: list` is wrong. Use `dataclasses.field` with `default_factory=list` like `some_var: list = field(default_factory=list)`
  - Build default value each time and instance of data class is created
  - So each new data class will have its own `list` instead of sharing the same list (common error)


### Post-init processing
- The `__init__` generated by `@dataclass` only takes the arguments passed and assigns them - or their default values, if missing - to the instance attributes that are instance fields.
- If you want to do more than initialize the instance, then use `__post_init_`
  - post init is called as last step, as it is added to the auto generated init.
  - Used for validation and computing field values based on other fields
- Creating a hierarchy of data classes is usually a bad idea (see chap 14)
- see `5_17_hackerclub.py`

### Typed Class Attributes
- Mypy for `5_17` is not happy: all_handles need type annotation
- If we add type hint `set[...]` to `all_handled`, then `@dataclass` will make `all_handles` an instance field (i.e. field that belongs to each INDIVIDUAL instance of class).
  - To make it happy we are supposed to declare `all_handles` like this
  - `all_handles: ClassVar[set[str]] = set()` (it is a class attribute of type set of str, with an empty set as its default value)

### Initialization variables that are not fields
- Sometimes need to apss arguments to init that are not instance fields.
- They are called `init-only variables`
- Use `InitVar`, with similar syntax of `typing.ClassVar`.
- `InitVar` will prevent `@dataclass` from treating it as regular field. it will not be set as an instance attribute, so `dataclasses.fields` will not list it.
- The variable will, though, be accepted by generated `__init__` and passed to `__post_init__`
